# üåê Cloud Infrastructure Design Documentation

## 1. Introduction

Cloud Infrastructure Design is the foundational blueprint for deploying, scaling, and managing applications in a cloud environment. It involves creating a robust architecture that aligns with business goals, ensuring scalability, security, cost-effectiveness, and high availability. This document outlines the strategy for designing cloud infrastructure, including key components, tools, and high-level workflows.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before proceeding with cloud infrastructure setup, ensure the following prerequisites are fulfilled:

- **Cloud Provider Access:** Active account with AWS, Azure, or GCP  
- **Networking Basics:** Understanding of VPC, subnets, CIDR, routing  
- **Tooling Setup:**  
  - Terraform / CloudFormation / Bicep installed  
  - CLI tools (e.g., AWS CLI, Azure CLI) configured  
- **IAM Policies:** Proper user roles and access management configured  
- **Budget & Compliance Requirements:** Predefined limits and regulations (GDPR, HIPAA)  
- **Source Control:** Git-based version control setup for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

---

## 3. System Development Approaches

We follow modern infrastructure development methodologies to build and manage cloud environments:

### a. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Tools: Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi
- Benefits: Version-controlled, repeatable, and auditable infrastructure

### b. Modular Architecture
- Break infra into modules: networking, compute, database, security
- Reusability and isolation of changes

### c. CI/CD for Infra
- Jenkins/GitHub Actions pipelines to test and deploy infrastructure automatically

### d. Environment Parity
- Use of variables and workspaces to replicate dev, test, and prod consistently

### e. GitOps Workflow
- All changes tracked via pull requests, promoting collaboration and review

## 4. 30,000-Foot View (High-Level Overview)

At a high level, the cloud infrastructure includes the following layers:

- **Networking Layer**  
  - VPC with public/private subnets  
  - NAT gateways and Internet gateways  
  - Route tables and security groups  

- **Compute Layer**  
  - EC2 Auto Scaling Groups or serverless (Lambda/Azure Functions)  
  - Container orchestration (ECS/EKS/AKS if required)

- **Data Layer**  
  - Managed databases: RDS, DynamoDB, Cloud SQL  
  - Object storage: S3, Blob Storage

- **Security Layer**  
  - IAM roles/policies  
  - Security groups, NACLs  
  - KMS for encryption

- **Monitoring & Logging**  
  - Cloud-native monitoring: CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Stackdriver  
  - Centralized log aggregation: ELK stack, Loki, etc.

- **Automation & Governance**  
  - CI/CD integration  
  - Cost management tools, tag enforcement  
  - Policy as code (Open Policy Agent, AWS SCPs)

## 6. Conclusion

A well-designed cloud infrastructure provides the foundation for application scalability, availability, and operational efficiency. By using Infrastructure as Code and modular design principles, teams can achieve consistency, automation, and agility. This document ensures that teams align with architectural best practices and cloud governance policies.
