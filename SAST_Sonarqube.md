## Introduction

In modern software development, Continuous Integration (CI) plays a crucial role in delivering high-quality applications faster and more reliably. Within CI pipelines, **Java-specific checks** and **static code analysis** ensure code quality, security, and maintainability before deployment.

---

##  What is Static Code Analysis

Static Code Analysis is the process of examining source code **without executing it**, to detect potential issues such as bugs, security vulnerabilities, code smells, or style violations.
