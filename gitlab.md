## 5. Best Practices for Using GitLab

| Practice                            | Recommendation                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Organize Repositories               | Use groups and subgroups for structure and access control.                     |
| Protected Branches                  | Prevent direct changes and enforce review workflows.                           |
| Efficient `.gitlab-ci.yml` Files   | Write clear, modular, and reusable pipeline configurations.                    |
| Use CI/CD Templates                 | Apply predefined templates for consistent pipelines.                           |
| Secret Management                  | Use environment variables or integrate HashiCorp Vault.                        |
| Enable Security Scans              | Run code quality and security checks early in the pipeline.                    |
| Optimize Pipeline Performance      | Use caching, parallel jobs, and minimize build time.                           |
| Auto DevOps                        | Quickly set up standard pipelines with minimal configuration.                  |
